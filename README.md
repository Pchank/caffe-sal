Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file contains our saliency detection models appeared in ICCV2017. We dive into the convolutional features in pre-trained FCN models and propose the following methods.

How to use
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:

Download source code from

Follow the official websites of the Caffe framework and install the whole toolbox (necessary Matlab wrappers)

1) Training

The training code is in ./models/Amulet and ./models/UCF. For saving memory, we use the BN method implemented by Alex Kendall etal http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/. The training is followed as examples in Caffe. 
We use the ImageData layer to load training image pairs. The data list can be generated by matlab in

The only need is changing the path of data files.

2) Testing

The testing code is in ./matlab/Amulet_test and ./models/UCF_test.

For dataset testing,

(1) Get prediction : test_saliency_dataset.m

(2) Get PR value : PR.m

(3) Plot PR curves: code_pr.m

(4) Plot Bar figures: code_bar.m

(5) Get MAE for each method : getmae.m

Note that we have provided the PR curves in ./PR_curves
